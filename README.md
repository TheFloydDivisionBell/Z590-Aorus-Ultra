# Z590 Aorus Ultra + i5-11600K + AMD 6600 XT OpenCore

<img src="AboutThisMac.png">

# Introduction

I was previously running a Z390i Aorus Pro WiFi with the i5-9600K which worked extremely well. I wanted to upgrade to a newer gen board and try to make use of my old Apple Thunderbolt display which works with the Alpine Ridge pcie card straight out of the box I was amazed to find! Other gen cards may need flashing.

I have now ditched the onboard Intel NIC and using my old BCM94360CS2 with a PCIE adapter which I will detail further down this guide.

# Summary of what works/doesn't work so far

:white_check_mark: WiFi

:white_check_mark: Bluetooth (Airpod's/Keyboard)

:white_check_mark: Audio (Although some more specific drivers are probably required)

:white_check_mark: 3.x USB's, USB C (Motherboard)

:white_check_mark: Handoff

:white_check_mark: Sleep/Wake

:white_check_mark: Displayport / HDMI

:white_check_mark: Ethernet (Needs additional config in the OS)

:white_check_mark: Airdrop, Unlock with Apple Watch

:x: Sidecar - I suspect something isn't configured quite right

:x: USB 2.0 ports - can't seem to figure out how to map them

:x: iGPU (Disabled in bios)

# BIOS

Disable:

- Fast Boot
- Secure Boot
- VT-D
- iGPU

Enable:

- Above 4G decoding
- Hyper-Threading
- EHCI/XHCI Hand-off
- OS Type: Windows
- SATA Mode: AHCI
- VT-X

There were others mentioned in the <a href="https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Install-Guide/pull/343">Add Rocket Lake Support PR - OpenCore-Install-Guide</a> but I was unable to locate them in my BIOS settings. I will revisit when I have more time.

# Software Configuration

I'm using the latest version of opencore 0.8.2 and running Mac OS Monterey

## Thunderbolt display & Alpine Ridge

To get the display working you simple plug in the alpine ridge card into a pcie slot and connect up to the thunderbolt header on the motherboard. Then use the loop back display cable between your GPU and the alpine ridge card. I then used an official Apple Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter to plug in the Thunderbolt 2 cable from the monitor. Worked instantly without any patches to the card.

## WiFi & Bluetooth

To get the BCM94360CS2 working I used an adapter from <a href="https://amzn.eu/d/1DfFikv">Amazon</a> which claimed to work natively without additional kexts. However it seemed I still needed to install the BCRM fixup, firmware and patch3 kexts. I already had the BCM card left over from a previous build but you can find them all over eBay.

## Ethernet

### config.plist
- I set my device property to PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1C,0x1)/Pci(0x0,0x0) -> device-id: F2150000
- I left the Kernel patch in place for I225-V (disabled: false) as it doesn't apply to Monterey anyway
- I set my boot arg to e1000=0

### OS Configuration
- In the advanced settings of my ethernet I set the hardware tab to 1000baseT, "full-duplex, flow-control", Standard (1500)

## USB Mapping
