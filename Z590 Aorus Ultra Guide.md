## Introduction

I was previously running a Z390i Aorus Pro WiFi with the i5-9600K which worked extremely well. I wanted to upgrade to a newer gen board and try to make use of my old Apple Thunderbolt display so I'm currently waiting for an Alpine Ridge Thunderbolt expansion card to arrive so that I can flash it and attempt to get it working. If it turns out to not be possible I will just sell the display and continue to use my MSI MAG274QRF-QD which works perfectly and I would personally recommend.

This is only my second hackintosh and is at the time of writing this guide only 2 days old so there's a lot to improve but I thought I would write it up so far as there are no guides for this specific motherboard from what I can find.
