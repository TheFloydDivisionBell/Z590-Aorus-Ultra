# Z590 Aorus Ultra + i5-11600K + AMD 6600 XT OpenCore

<img src="AboutThisMac.png">

# Introduction

I was previously running a Z390i Aorus Pro WiFi with the i5-9600K which worked extremely well. I wanted to upgrade to a newer gen board and try to make use of my old Apple Thunderbolt display so I'm currently waiting for an Alpine Ridge Thunderbolt expansion card to arrive so that I can flash it and attempt to get it working. If it turns out to not be possible I will just sell the display and continue to use my MSI MAG274QRF-QD which works perfectly and I would personally recommend.

This is only my second hackintosh and is at the time of writing this guide only 2 days old so there's a lot to improve but I thought I would write it up so far as there are no guides for this specific motherboard from what I can find.

# Summary of what works/doesn't work so far

:white_check_mark: Bluetooth (Airpod's/Keyboard)

:white_check_mark: Audio (Although some more specific drivers are probably required)

:white_check_mark: 3.x USB's, USB C (Motherboard)

:white_check_mark: Handoff

:white_check_mark: Sleep/Wake

:white_check_mark: Displayport / HDMI

:x: Airdrop (need to fiddle)

:x: Unlock with Apple Watch, Sidecar

:x: USB 2.x (Disabled due to port limits)

:x: Thunderbolt (on outer case - need to fiddle with usb map)

There were others mentioned in the <a href="https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Install-Guide/pull/343">Add Rocket Lake Support PR - OpenCore-Install-Guide</a> but I was unable to locate them in my BIOS settings. I will revisit when I have more time.

# Software Configuration

I'm using the latest version of opencore 0.8.2 and running Mac OS Monterey
